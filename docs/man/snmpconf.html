<H2>NAME</H2>

snmpconf - creates and modifies SNMP configuration files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>snmpconf</B>

[OPTIONS] [fileToCreate]
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Start with:<DD>
<B>snmpconf</B>

-g basic_setup
<DT>Or even just:<DD>
<B>snmpconf</B>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>snmpconf</B>

is a simple Perl script that walks you through setting up a
configuration file step by step.  It should be fairly straight forward
to use.  Merely run it and answer its questions.
<P>

In its default mode of operation, it prompts the user with menus
showing sections of the various configuration files it knows about.
When the user selects a section, a sub-menu is shown listing of the
descriptions of the tokens that can be created in that section.  When
a description is selected, the user is prompted with questions that
construct the configuration line in question.
<P>

Finally, when the user quits the program any configuration files that
have been edited by the user are saved to the local directory, fully
commented.
<P>

A particularly useful option is the
<B>-g</B>

switch, which walks a user through a specific set of configuration
questions.  Run:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

snmpconf -g basic_setup
</DL>

<P>

for an example.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Force overwriting existing files in the current directory without
prompting the user if this is a desired thing to do.
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
When finished, install the files into the location where the global
system commands expect to find them.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
When finished, install the files into the users home directory's .snmp
subdirectory (where the applications will also search for
configuration files).
<DT><B>-I</B><I> DIRECTORY</I>

<DD>
When finished, install the files into the directory 
<I>DIRECTORY</I>.

<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Don't ask any questions.  Simply read in the various known
configuration files and write them back out again.  This has the
effect of &quot;auto-commenting&quot; the configuration files for you.  See
the
<B>NEAT TRICKS</B>

section below.
<DT><B>-r</B><I>all|none</I>

<DD>
Read in either all or none of the found configuration files.  Normally
<B>snmpconf</B>

prompts you for which files you wish to read in.  Reading in
these configuration files will merge these files with the results of
the questions that it asks of you.
<DT><B>-R</B><I> FILE,...</I>

<DD>
Read in a specific list of configuration files.
<DT><B>-g</B><I> GROUPNAME</I>

<DD>
Groups of configuration entries can be created that can be used to
walk a user through a series of questions to create an initial
configuration file.  There are no menus to navigate, just a list of
questions.  Run:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

snmpconf -g basic_setup
</DL>

<P>

for a good example.
</DL>

<DT><B>-G</B>

<DD>
List all the known groups.
<DT><B>-c</B><I> CONFIGDIR</I>

<DD>
<B>snmpconf</B>

uses a directory of configuration information to learn about
the files and questions that it should be asking.  This option tells
<B>snmpconf</B>

to use a different location for configuring itself.
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Run slightly more quietly.  Since this is an interactive program, I
don't recommend this option since it only removes information from the
output that is designed to help you.
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Turn on 
<B>lots</B>

of debugging output.
<DT><B>-D</B>

<DD>
Add 
<B>even more</B>

debugging output in the form of Perl variable dumps.
<DT><DD>

<H2>NEAT TRICKS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>snmpconf -g basic_setup<DD>
Have I mentioned this command enough yet?  It's designed to walk
someone through an initial setup for the
<I><A HREF="snmpd.html>snmpd</A>(8)</I>

daemon.  Really, you should try it.
<DT>snmpconf -R /usr/local/snmp/snmpd.conf -a -f snmpd.conf<DD>
Automatically reads in an snmpd.conf file (for example) and adds
comments to them describing what each token does.  Try it.  It's cool.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>snmpconf</B>

is actually a very generic utility that could be easily
configured to help construct just about any kind of configuration
file.  Its default configuration set of files are SNMP based.
