    <h2>NAME</h2>snmp_config - handling of Net-SNMP configuration files <a name="lbAC" id="lbAC"> </a>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>The Net-SNMP package uses various configuration files to configure its applications. This manual page
    merely describes the overall nature of them, so that the other manual pages don't have to. <a name="lbAD" id="lbAD"> </a>

    <h2>DIRECTORIES SEARCHED</h2>First off, there are numerous places that configuration files can be found and read from. By
    default, the applications look for configuration files in the following 4 directories, in order: /usr/local/etc/snmp,
    /usr/local/share/snmp, /usr/local/lib/snmp, and $HOME/.snmp. In each of these directories, it looks for files with the
    extension of both <i>conf</i> and <i>local.conf</i> (reading the second ones last). In this manner, there are 8 default
    places a configuration file can exist for any given configuration file type.

    <p>Additionally, the above default search path can be overridden by setting the environment variable SNMPCONFPATH to a
    colon-separated list of directories to search for. The path for the persistent data should be included when running
    applications that use persistent storage, such as snmpd.</p>

    <p>Applications will read persistent configuration files in the following order of preference:</p>

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dd>
        <p>file in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE</b> environment variable</p>

        <p>directories in <b>SNMPCONFPATH</b> environment variable</p>

        <p>directory defined by <b>persistentDir</b> snmp.conf variable</p>

        <p>directory in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR</b> environment variable</p>

        <p>default <b>/var/net-snmp</b> directory</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Finally, applications will write persistent configuration files in the following order of preference:</p>

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dd>
        <p>file in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE</b> environment variable</p>

        <p>directory defined by <b>persistentDir</b> snmp.conf variable</p>

        <p>directory in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR</b> environment variable</p>

        <p>default <b>/var/net-snmp</b> directory</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Note: When using SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE, the filename should match the application name. For example,
    /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf. <a name="lbAE" id="lbAE"> </a></p>

    <h2>CONFIGURATION FILE TYPES</h2>Each application may use multiple configuration files, which will configure various
    different aspects of the application. For instance, the SNMP agent (<b>snmpd</b>) knows how to understand configuration
    directives in both the snmpd.conf and the snmp.conf files. In fact, most applications understand how to read the contents of
    the snmp.conf files. Note, however, that configuration directives understood in one file may not be understood in another
    file. For further information, read the associated manual page with each configuration file type. Also, most of the
    applications support a <b>-H</b> switch on the command line that will list the configuration files it will look for and the
    directives in each one that it understands.

    <p>The snmp.conf configuration file is intended to be a application suite wide configuration file that supports directives
    that are useful for controlling the fundamental nature of all of the SNMP applications, such as how they all manipulate and
    parse the textual SNMP MIB files. <a name="lbAF" id="lbAF"> </a></p>

    <h2>SWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE</h2>It's possible to switch in mid-file the configuration type that the parser
    is supposed to be reading. Since that sentence doesn't make much sense, lets give you an example: say that you wanted to turn
    on packet dumping output for the agent by default, but you didn't want to do that for the rest of the applications (ie,
    snmpget, snmpwalk, ...). Normally to enable packet dumping in the configuration file you'd need to put a line like:

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dd>dumpPacket true</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>into the snmp.conf file. But, this would turn it on for all of the applications. So, instead, you can put the same line in
    the snmpd.conf file so that it only applies to the snmpd daemon. However, you need to tell the parser to expect this line.
    You do this by putting a special type specification token inside a [] set. In other words, inside your snmpd.conf file you
    could put the above snmp.conf directive by adding a line like so:</p>

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dd>[snmp] dumpPacket true</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This tells the parser to parse the above line as if it were inside a snmp.conf file instead of an snmpd.conf file. If you
    want to parse a bunch of lines rather than just one then you can make the context switch apply to the remainder of the file
    or until the next context switch directive by putting the special token on a line by itself:</p>

    <dl compact="compact">
      <dd>
        <pre>
# make this file handle snmp.conf tokens:
[snmp]
dumpPacket true
logTimestamp true
# return to our original snmpd.conf tokens:
[snmpd]
rocommunity mypublic
</pre>
      </dd>
    </dl><a name="lbAG" id="lbAG"> </a>

    <h2>COMMENTS</h2>

    <p>Any lines beginning with the character '#' in the configuration files are treated as a comment and are not parsed.

    <h2>API INTERFACE</h2>

    <p>Information about writing C code that makes use of this system in either the agent's MIB modules or in applications can be
    found in the <i><a href="read_config.html">read_config</a>(3)</i> manual page. <a name="lbAI" id="lbAI"> </a></p>
