[common options] [-Ca] [-Cn] [-Cs] [-CP protocol] AGENT
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>snmpnetstat </B>

command symbolically displays the values of various network-related
information retrieved from a remote system using the SNMP protocol.
There are a number of output formats,
depending on the options for the information presented.
The first form of the command displays a list of active sockets.
The second form presents the values of other network-related
information according to the option selected.
Using the third form, with an 
<I>interval</I>

specified,
<I>snmpnetstat</I>

will continuously display the information regarding packet
traffic on the configured network interfaces.
The fourth form displays statistics about the named protocol.
<P>

<B>snmpnetstat</B>

will issue GETBULK requests to query for information
if at least protocol version
<I>v2</I>

is used.
<P>

AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is
instrumented to monitor the given objects.
At its simplest, the AGENT specification will
consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address. In this
situation, the command will attempt communication
with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
given target host. See <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+snmpcmd">snmpcmd</A>(1) for a full list of
the possible formats for AGENT.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The options have the following meaning:
<P>

<B>common options</B>

<BR>&nbsp;Please&nbsp;see
<I><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+snmpcmd">snmpcmd</A>(1)</I>

for a list of possible values for common options
as well as their descriptions.
<P>

<B>-Ca</B>

With the default display,
show the state of all sockets; normally sockets used by
server processes are not shown.
<P>

<B>-Ci</B>

Show the state of all of the network interfaces.
The  interface  display  provides  a  table  of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and collisions.
The  network addresses of the interface and the maximum transmission 
unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.
<P>

<B>-Co</B>

Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets in place of packets.
This is useful when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as Frame-Relay circuits)
on a router.
<P>

<B>-CI</B><I> interface</I>

Show information only about this interface;
used with an
<I>interval</I>

as described below.
<P>

<B>-Cn</B>

Show network addresses as numbers (normally 
<I>snmpnetstat</I>

interprets addresses and attempts to display them
symbolically).
This option may be used with any of the display formats.
<P>

<B>-CP</B><I> protocol</I>

Show statistics about 
<I>protocol,</I>

which is either a well-known name for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some
protocol names and aliases are listed in the file 
<I>/etc/protocols</I>.

A null response typically means that there are no interesting numbers to 
report.
The program will complain if
<I>protocol</I>

is unknown or if there is no statistics routine for it.
<P>

<B>-Cs</B>

Show per-protocol statistics.  When used with the
<B>-Cr</B>

option, show routing statistics instead.
<P>

<B>-Cr</B>

Show the routing tables.
When
<B>-Cs</B>

is also present, show per-protocol routing statistics instead of 
the routing tables.
<P>

<B>-CR</B><I> repeaters</I>

For GETBULK requests,
<I>repeaters</I>

specifies the max-repeaters value to use.
<P>

When  snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument, it
displays a running count of statistics related to  network
interfaces.
<I>interval</I>

is the number of seconds between
reporting of statistics.
<P>

<I>The Active Sockets Display (default)</I>

<P>

The default display, for active sockets, shows the local
and remote addresses, protocol, and the internal state  of
the   protocol.    Address   formats   are   of  the  form
``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if  a  socket's  address
specifies  a  network  but no specific host address.  When
known, the host and network addresses are displayed symbolically
according   to  the  data  bases 
<I>/etc/hosts  and</I>

<I>/etc/networks,</I>

respectively.  If a symbolic  name  for  an
address  is unknown, or if the
<B>-Cn</B>

option is specified, the
address is printed numerically, according to  the  address
family.  For more information regarding the Internet ``dot
format,'' refer  to
<I><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3N+inet">inet</A>(3N).</I>

Unspecified,  or  ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.
<P>

<I>The Interface Display</I>

<P>

The  interface  display  provides  a  table  of cumulative
statistics regarding packets transferred, errors, and col-
lisions.   The  network addresses of the interface and the
maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.
<P>

<I>The Routing Table Display</I>

<P>

The routing table display indicates the  available  routes
and  their  status.   Each route consists of a destination
host or network and a gateway to use in  forwarding  pack-
ets.   The flags field shows the state of the route (``U''
if ``up''), whether the route is  to  a  gateway  (``G''),
whether  the  route  was created dynamically by a redirect
(``D''), and whether the route  has  been  modified  by  a
redirect  (``M'').   Direct  routes  are  created for each
interface attached to the local host;  the  gateway  field
for  such entries shows the address of the outgoing inter-
face.  The interface entry indicates the network interface
utilized for the route.
<P>

<I>The Interface Display with an Interval</I>

<P>

When
<I>snmpnetstat</I>

is invoked with an
<I>interval</I>

argument, it
displays a running count of statistics related to  network
interfaces.   This  display  consists  of a column for the
primary interface and a column summarizing information for
all  interfaces.   The  primary  interface may be replaced
with another interface with the
<B>-CI</B>

option.  The first line
of each screen of information contains a summary since the
system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of output show
values accumulated over the preceding interval.
<P>

<I>The Active Sockets Display for a </I>

<I>Single Protocol</I>

<P>

When a protocol is specified with the
<B>-CP</B>

option, the
information displayed is similar to that in the
default display for active sockets, except the
display is limited to the given protocol.
