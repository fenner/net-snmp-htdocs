<p class="SectionTitle">Release Schedule</p>

<p>The Net-SNMP project has adopted a release schedule target
of issuing a "leading-edge" version of the code (either
a new branch, or a minor-number release of the most recent branch)
approximately every three months (or more quickly if this is
deemed appropriate).
The aim is to ensure that patches, bug fixes and new features
will be made generally available reasonably promptly.

<p>The previous two code branches will continue to see minor-number
releases, to ensure that bug fixes on those lines also make it into
active service.  Earlier branches will typically be marked as
"end-of-line", and will see no further development activity
(other than in exceptional circumstances).

<p>However, starting with the 5.4.x line, every third code branch
will be designated a <B>Long Term Release</B>.  Instead of being
marked "end-of-line" when the next-but-two branch is first released,
such lines will continue to be maintained until the next-but-fifth
branch appears.  Note that both of these are also Long Term Release
branches - hence there will always be two Long Term Release, and two
normal code branches receiving active support and development.

<H3>Release Timing</H3>
<p>As indicated above, the aim is to issue a leading-edge release every
three months or so.  Releases on the older lines are likely to be less
frequent, but should appear every six to nine months - although this may
well stretch as the code matures and attention switches to the newer
lines.  (There's no point in making a release on a new branch just for
the sake of it, unless there are actually some changes or bug fixes to
be made available.)

<p>Note that these are general guidelines, rather than firm commitments,
and we fully expect to miss this timescale as often as not.
Similarly any release dates in the tables below should be regarded as
provisional targets.
All questions relating to schedule timelines should be sent to the
