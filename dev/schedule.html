<p class="SectionTitle">Release Schedule</p>

<p>The Net-SNMP project has adopted a provision release schedule
policy of releasing a "leading-edge" version of the code (either
a new branch, or a minor-number release of the most recent branch)
approximately every three months.
This isn't intended as a firm guarantee, and we fully expect to
miss this timescale as often as not.  But hopefully this target
will mean that patches, bug fixes and new features will be made
generally available reasonably promptly.  Of course, this policy
will not prevent releases being made more frequently, if this
proves necessary (e.g. a security problem, or the bedding down
of significant new features).

<p>The provisional aim is to make a new branch (or "major-number")
release probably every nine to twelve months, and certainly not more
frequently than every six months (barring exceptional circumstances),
with a number of branch updates (or "minor number" releases) in between.
This should provide some measure of stability for those who need a
solid, reliable SNMP environment, rather than the latest features.
Again, this target is intended for guidance rather than as a rigid
timetable, and we probably wouldn't release a new branch just for
the sake of it.

<p>There are currently five separate lines of code, although not all
of these are actively being maintained.  The following table depicts
our <b><font color="red">tentative</font></b> release schedule.
Note that the 4.2.x and 5.0.x lines are basically being closed down -
there will probably be no further work done on either of these
(barring <I>very</I> exceptional circumstances).
