    <h1>Net-SNMP Release Policy</h1>

    <h2>Important Note</h2>

    <p>This policy becomes fully active January 1st, 2006.  It has
    been in use prior to this time.  This is merely a written
    representation of what has been roughly done for a while now.
    Issues with this policy statement should be discussed on
    -coders.</p>

    <p>Note: not proof read yet.  sorry.</p>

    <h2>Net-SNMP Release Policy</h2>
    <p>Net-SNMP strives to be a highly stable package for its
      end-users.  To achieve that we strive to meet a number of goals.
      Namely:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Backwards-compatibility unless impossible.</li>
      <li> Bug fixes released for multiple branches of our source tree
	(we maintain the last few branches in our source repository and
	frequently release versions which appear "older" than the most
	recent major version number).
      <li> Stable packages that have been well tested and were
	properly frozen during the release cycle..</li>
    </ol>

    <p> This document describes how Net-SNMP development happens in
    CVS branches that are nearing release time.  This is written as
    policy, however it is impossible to encode solid lines between
    many of the issues discussed below.  People are the final judge
    and the only hard-definition/rule in this document is the +N
    voting, discussed below.  Don't argue over whether something meets
    the criteria of the show-stopper definition.  Instead, just get +N
    votes to accept the patch as it will save time and reduce the
    arguing to the technical issue (you know, the important one)
    instead of the philosophical one.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    The following terms are used in this document.

    <h3>Release Manager</h3>

    <p>The person responsible for producing the current release being
      discussed.  Release managers are appointed and are listed in the
      <a href="schedule.html">schedule document</a>.</p>

    <h3>+N:</h3>

    <p>+N means that at least +N people agreed to something
      over those that disagreed.  +N = "yes votes" minus "no votes".
    </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Example: a +3 requirement to include a
	patch in a RC release cycle means developers indicating support
	for applying the patch would need at least 3 votes greater than
	those who object (EG, tallies of 3-0, 4-1, 5-2, ...).</li>

      <li> A vote discussion will last at least 24 hours in
	length.  Saturdays and Sundays are excluding from the counting
	period.</li>

      <li>Any regular participant on the -coders list (subscribed for
	at least the last 3 months and reading the discussions there)
	can vote in such a discussion, but must be able to demonstrate
	understanding of the issue and code.</li>

      <li>Everyone gets 1 vote on
	a subject, except for the person who is currently actively
	maintaining/writing a given section of code.  They get 1.001
	votes.</li>

      <li>Voting on serious issues can delay a scheduled release for a
	period of time in order for the vote to take place.  A release
	manager may need to make a judgment call here, however, and
	release earlier than the technical end of the voting period.</li>


    </ul>

    <h3>Supported System:</h3>

    <p>A OS for which there is a current active developer working on
      ensure that the package works properly on said system.  (We
      can't force developers to work on a platform without interest.)</p>

    <h3>Show stopper:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Any error that when discussed on the coders list is agreed
      upon by at least +3 developers during the RC phase of release.</li>

      <li>a condition such that a default
	<i>"configure; make; make install"</i>
	fails to complete successfully on a supported system.
      </li>

      <li>a condition such that
	<i>"make test"</i> fails to complete successfully on a
	supported system, (excluding problems within the test suite
	itself)
      </li>

      <li>A condition that is security related (introduction of a new
      attack, especially for ones related to processing before
      authentication is done.)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />
    <h2>Release Cycle:</h2>

    <p> The Net-SNMP package follows the following steps in release
    software from a CVS branch:

    <pre>
      Open Development => Pre-Releases => Release-Candidates => Final Release
    </pre>

    <h3>Open Development</h3>

    <p> Anyone with write access to the repository can submit changes
      at will including new features.</p>

    <h3>Pre-Releases</h3>

    <p> Pre-Releases are released using version numbers such as
      5.1.3.pre1, and during the period between when the first
      pre-release is made available to the point where the first
      release-candidate is made available:
    </p>

      <ul>
      <li> Only bug fixes should
	be checked in by developers with write access (no new
	features).</li>

      <li> Serious issues should be discussed on the -coders list first, but
	generally patches can be committed to fix bugs as needed.</li>

      <li> Developers that disagree that a patch should have been
	committed should bring up the issue on the -coders list.  A vote
	of +1 is needed to keep the patch in place.</li>

      <li>No new features are allowed.</li>

      <li>Generally the Pre-Release phase lasts for
	3-4 weeks, at one pre-release per week or two.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Release-Candidates</h3>

    <p> Release-Candidates are released using version numbers such as
    5.1.3.rc1.  Ideally, the final release should exactly match the
    last release candidate except for version numbering changes.
    During the period between when the first release-candidate is made
    available to the point where the final release is made available:
    </p>
      <ul>

      <li> Any changes to the CVS tree require a +3 vote on the
      -coders list.  This vote <b>MUST</b> take place prior to
      committing them to the CVS tree.</li>
      
      <li>Only show-stopper bugs should be fixed at this point.</li> 

      <li>No new features are allowed.</li>

      <li>Generally the Pre-Release phase lasts for
	3-4 weeks, at one pre-release per week or two.</li>
      
      <li>Changes to documentation (but not documentation building
      systems) are allowed.</li>

      <li>Changes to comments (doxygen documentation included) are
      allowed except after what is expected to be the last RC
      version.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Final Release</h3>

    <p>There's nothing left to do right?  Hopefully.  But in the odd
    case that something does slip through:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> A patch branch should be created for major releases (X.Y)
      if it doesn't exist yet.  These are labeled (tagged)
      V<i>X</i>-<i>Y</i>-patches in the CVS tree.</li>

      <li> The CVS tree right after a release continues in freeze mode
      (same as the release-candidate phase) for at least 1 week beyond
      the time the final release is published.</li>

      <li> If a major bug is found in the final release, a vote of +3
      on -coders will result in a new immediate release with a minor
      minor version number increment (the Z in W.X.Y.Z).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />
    <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>

    <p>Under the above guidelines this shouldn't happen.  The voting
    system is provided to alleviate these types of major issues.</p>

    <p>However...  Disputes will be resolved based on the following
    order of precedence:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>+N vote as discussed above.  For issues which didn't have a +N
	vote specified (I.E., missed in the above documentation)
	consider it +3</li>

      <li>The release manager</li>

      <li>Active project core-developers by seniority</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>Much of this was codified by Dave Shield originally.</p>

    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <p>We're all friends generally, but just to be clear: attempts to
    misuse this policy will be severely frowned upon.  Don't test me.</p>
