The Net-SNMP logo

<p>The above logo was created with the gracious help of UCD-SNMP and Net-SNMP users who sent in a postcard to help create this logo.  This is a true demonstration of the internet oriented aspect of this project.</p>

<h3>Sending in a Postcard</h3>
<p>It's unlikely that we'll be creating a new logo with postcards
anytime in the near future so we've stopped accepting post cards at
this time.</p>
<h3>How was it created?</h3>
<ol>
<li>All postcards were mass scanned using a script I wrote that could scan 4 postcards at a time (one in each corner of my scanner) while I did other work. I wrote the script for scanning sets of
photographs, and making it work for postcards was trivial. This is the reason that many of the postcard images aren't perfectly cropped though.</li>
<li>A single postcard was repeatedly used to lay out the diagram using xfig.</li>
<li>The xfig save file (which is ascii) was converted to reference all the postcards rather than just the single repeated one, and then used to turn the layout into a jpeg.</li>
<li>The drop shadow and bluring was added using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A side affect to this process is that xfig outputs its save file in fairly random order, so everytime I create a new logo the postcards are randomly placed. The only ones that are consistent are
the 2 composing the dash in the center, which are a postcard from UCDavis and a picture of the <a href="/party/">first ucd-snmp roundtable</a>.</p>
